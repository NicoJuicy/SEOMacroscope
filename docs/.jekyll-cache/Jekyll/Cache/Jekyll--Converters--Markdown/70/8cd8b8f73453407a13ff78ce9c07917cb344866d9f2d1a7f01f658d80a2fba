I"Q<p class="lead">This will hopefully be the final beta of SEO Macroscope before I bump the version number to 1.0. Source code and an installer can be found on GitHub at:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/nazuke/SEOMacroscope/releases/tag/v0.9.0.4b">https://github.com/nazuke/SEOMacroscope/releases/tag/v0.9.0.4b</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Please check the <a href="/SEOMacroscope/downloads/">downloads page</a> for more recent versions.</p>

<p>I’ve spent most of the time cleaning up bugs, tuning features, and tidying up the displays.</p>

<h2 id="features-added-include">Features added include:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Logging and reporting of relative/absolute URLs used in pages.</li>
  <li>Support and detection of text-based sitemaps.</li>
  <li>Cosmetic enhancements in overview and document details panels.</li>
  <li>Added Remarks report, for arbitrary problems discovered during a crawl.</li>
  <li>Implemented support for inline CSS processing, to find links to external CSS assets.</li>
  <li>Query strings may now be ignored.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are still a few bugs, such as the calculation of duplicate titles; but I’m finding that this is becoming pretty useful in daily work.</p>
