I"a<p class="lead">This release of SEO Macroscope includes support for English language text readability scoring. Implementations of the Flesch-Kincaid or SMOG algorithms may be applied to the body text of web pages, giving a simple score as to the “readability” of the page text. This may then be used to further refine the page text to suit the target audience.</p>

<p>Source code and an installer can be found on GitHub at:</p>
