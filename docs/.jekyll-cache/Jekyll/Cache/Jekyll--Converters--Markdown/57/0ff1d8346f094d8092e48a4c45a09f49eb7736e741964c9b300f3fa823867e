I"@<p class="lead">This release of SEO Macroscope includes support for HTTP/2 on Windows 10, and accelerates near-duplicate content detection. HTTP/2 support enables the application to work with websites that do not also support HTTP/1.1 as a fallback option.</p>

<p>As well as numerous bugs being fixed, the Levenshtein analysis of near-duplicate content has also been accelerated, by generating a <em>“Levenshtein Fingerprint”</em> of the document text of each web page as it is crawled. There are two analysis level options, with the second being slower but may help to eliminate false positives.</p>

<p>Where possible, the full text of PDF documents may be extracted, analyzed for readability, and URLs extracted. Currently, URLs found in the text will be added as additional outlinks from the PDF.</p>

<p>In some cases, QR Codes in linked image files on the site may be detected as containing a link. These can be further crawled.</p>

<p>In the source, I have also begun exploratory work on refactoring the core of SEO Macroscope into an “engine” library, with a view to building a CLI interface, and an updated WPF-based GUI. It would also be useful to be able to run multiple crawls concurrently, instead of only the currently supported single crawl.</p>

<p>Source code and an installer can be found on GitHub at:</p>
