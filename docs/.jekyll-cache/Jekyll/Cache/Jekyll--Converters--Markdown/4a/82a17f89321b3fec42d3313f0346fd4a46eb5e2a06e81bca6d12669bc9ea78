I"à<p class="lead">Iâ€™ve been implementing a few more Excel Reports so that we can actually dump out the information that SEO Macroscope gathers into some sort of useful format for ingestion into other tools.</p>

<p>The most recent additions are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Broken Links:</strong> Reporting which links on the site are broken in some way, along with the pages that link to them.</li>
  <li><strong>URI Analysis:</strong> Including a complete mapping of all from/to links within the spidered collection, indicators of duplicated content, and redirected URLs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, Iâ€™ve added a new <strong>Links</strong> tab to the Overview panels, which gives a live and searchable from/to link map of the spidered collection.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m working towards another beta release, but currently, the source code can be checked out directly from GitHub. Please take a look on the <a href="/SEOMacroscope/downloads/">Downloads</a> page for where to grab the source code.</p>
