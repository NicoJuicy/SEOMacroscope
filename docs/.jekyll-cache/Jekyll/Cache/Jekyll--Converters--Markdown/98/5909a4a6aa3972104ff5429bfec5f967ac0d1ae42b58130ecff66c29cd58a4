I"§<p class="lead">As a long time user of the excellent <a href="http://home.snafu.de/tilman/xenulink.html">Xenu Link Sleuth</a>, Iâ€™ve been wanting to have something that does the basic job of link checking, but also offers a few more features that I need to use from time to time.</p>

<p class="screenshot"><img src="/SEOMacroscope/manual/images/application-001.png" alt="SEO Macroscope main application window" class="img-responsive box-shadow" /></p>

<p>Iâ€™ve taken a look around every now and then to see if thereâ€™s an open source application like Xenu, but have not found something suitable yet.</p>

<p>So, after picking up a bit of C# for another project recently, I finally got around to working on an application myself.</p>

<p>I started the project in late 2016, and this is still very much a work-in-progress with a great many features that still need to be implemented; however, itâ€™s in a functional state already.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m developing this in <a href="http://www.icsharpcode.net/opensource/sd/Default.aspx">SharpDevelop</a>, targeting Windows only for the time being, and the source project can be found on GitHub at:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/nazuke/SEOMacroscope">https://github.com/nazuke/SEOMacroscope</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Currently, this is somewhere between alpha and beta quality.</p>

<p>There are plenty of bugs to be found, and missing features, but Iâ€™m already using this in my daily work.</p>
