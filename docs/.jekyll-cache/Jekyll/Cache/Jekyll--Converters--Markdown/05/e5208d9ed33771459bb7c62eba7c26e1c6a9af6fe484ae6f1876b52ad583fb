I"ò<p class="lead">The third beta of SEO Macroscope has been released. Source code and an installer can be found on GitHub at:</p>

</ul>

<p>Please check the <a href="/SEOMacroscope/downloads/">downloads page</a> for more recent versions.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve reworked the tracking of linked documents, and hyperlinks across the crawled collection.</p>

<p>More details may be found in the release notes.</p>

<p>Next, I plan on writing the rest of the manual, and work towards a version 1.0 release.</p>

<p>This version, however, seems to be firming up to be pretty useful for everyday work. So far, itâ€™s been helping me to find rogue branding on my companyâ€™s site, amongst other things.</p>
