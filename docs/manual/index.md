<!-- *********************************************************************** -->

## Help Contents
{:.no_toc}

* TOC
{:toc}

<!-- *********************************************************************** -->

## Getting Started

To run a link scan of a website, simply enter a valid URL into the **Start URL** field, and click **Start**.
{:.lead}

The running scan may be stopped at any time by clicking **Stop**. It may be resumed again by clicking **Continue**.

To clear the results of a full or partial scan, click **Reset**. Also, editing the **Start URL** will clear and reset the current scanned collection.

{% include go-to-top.html %}

<!-- *********************************************************************** -->

## File Menu

Export sitemaps in text and XML formats, and list views to CSV and Excel files.

### Load Lists

A list of URLs to be scanned may be either loaded from a text file, or pasted from the clipboard. The scanning process is the same for either method.

### Export Sitemaps

The crawled results may be exported to XML or Text format sitemap files.

### Export Reports

The currently viewed list may be exported to CSV or Excel format files. This option is most useful for those list views that do not have their own report option, such as the search results list.

{% include go-to-top.html %}

<!-- *********************************************************************** -->

## Preferences Menu

The default preferences are set to enable modest spidering of your site, but will omit attempting to download large files, will not descend into localized pages, and will not perform some of the more intense SEO analyses.

Some expensive processing options are also disabled by default, such as deep keyword analysis. Check these options, as some of them need to be enabled before crawling takes place.

Please refer to the preferences settings before beginning a spidering job.

{% include go-to-top.html %}

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

### Spidering Control

These settings control how SEO Macroscope crawls the links on your site.

![SEO Macroscope spidering control preferences](images/preferences-spidering-control.png){: .img-responsive .box-shadow .screenshot}

#### Standards

##### Follow Robot Rules (Partially implemented)

SEO Macroscope will honour the robots.txt directives, if present. Currently, this includes only those directives for the wildcard user agent.

As of this time, on-page robot directives are not implemented yet.

If present, the **crawl delay** directive in the robots.txt will be followed. Please note however that this delay is set per-thread. Which means that if crawling with 4 threads with a delay of 1 second, then your site may receive 4 requests per-second. Set the thread count low to begin with.

Also see **Crawl Delay** in the **Spidering Limits** section.

##### Follow Sitemap Links (Partially implemented)

SEO Macroscope will attempt to discover Google Sitemap XML files specified by your website, and follow the links in them.

The application will also use this setting to probe for well-known sitemap URLs.

For example:

    https://www.company.com/sitemap.xml

#### Links

##### Check redirects

If this option is checked, then SEO Macroscope will log and check redirects.

External URLs will only be logged.

##### Follow redirects

If this option is checked, then SEO Macroscope will log and follow redirects.

Redirected URLs will count as being internal hosts. Use caution here, as enabling this option may result in lengthy or infinite crawls.

In general, it is safer to crawl the sites redirected to separately.

External URLs will only be logged.

##### Follow canonical links

If this option is checked, then SEO Macroscope will log and follow canonical links, if present.

External URLs will only be logged.

##### Follow alternate links

If this option is checked, then SEO Macroscope will log and follow links element that have their rel attribute set as "alternate".

External URLs will only be logged.

##### Follow rel="nofollow" links

If this option is checked, then SEO Macroscope will log and follow HTML links that are set to "nofollow", otherwise, those links will not be crawled.

##### Follow HrefLang links

If this option is checked, then SEO Macroscope will log and follow HrefLang links in the head section of HTML pages.

Please note that this will also mark localized hosts as being "internal" hosts.

##### Ignore URL queries

If this option is enabled, then the query string will be stripped from the URL, and the resultant URL crawled.

##### Ignore hash fragment

If this option is enabled, then the hash fragment will be stripped from the URL, and the resultant URL crawled.

In many cases, this may help to speed up crawling, as it will help to prevent duplicate content from being crawled.

##### Strict URL check

If this option is enabled, then strict include/exclude URL checking is applied before each URL is added to the crawl queue.

This may help to speed up the crawling process.

#### Domain Restrictions

##### Check External Links

If this option is checked, then SEO Macroscope will log and follow links that are on external hosts.

Please note, this may result in an infinite crawl, or may otherwise take an extremely long time to complete.

Use the include/exclude *Task Parameters* to explicitly specify which external hosts you may potentially like to crawl.

#### Spidering Limits

These options control how aggressive SEO Macroscope is in its crawling.

Set low values to begin with.

##### Maximum Worker Threads

SEO Macroscope uses a threaded model to manage crawl workers.

To be conservative, set the number of threads to 1 initially.

Please note that the thread count combines with the *Crawl Delay*. The *Crawl Delay* applies to each thread, which means that your site may receive a request equal to the number of threads every *Crawl Delay* second(s).

##### Maximum Page Depth

Counting from the website's document root of /, this is the maximum depth that SEO Macroscope will fetch a particular URL.

##### Maximum Pages To Fetch

This is approximately the maximum number of pages that SEO Macroscope will attempt to fetch.

It may fetch slightly more than this number.

##### Crawl Delay (seconds)

This overrides the *Crawl Delay* that may be set by the robots.txt directives for the website.

If set, then SEO Macroscope will pause after fetching each page in each thread for *Crawl Delay* second(s).

##### Request Timeout (seconds)

Set this to how long before SEO Macroscope should wait for a response from the server.

##### Maximum Fetch Retries

Set this to the number of attempts that SEO Macroscope should make when retrieving a page.

If you have a fast web server, then set this to a reasonably low value. Setting it too high may slow down the overall crawl if your web server is slow to respond.

#### Crawl Link Types

Please note that HTML documents are *always* crawled. Otherwise, to speed things up, we can exclude document types that we are not interested in crawling. In general, excluded document types may still have a HEAD request issued against them, but they will not be downloaded and crawled further.

##### CSS stylesheets

Enabling this option will cause CSS stylesheets to be fetched, and crawled.

Please not that currently, there is partial support for crawling further linked assets, such as background images, within stylesheets.

##### Javascripts

Enabling this option will cause Javascripts to be checked. Beyond that, no further crawling occurs with Javascripts.

##### Images

Enabling this option will cause images to be checked. Beyond that, no further crawling occurs with images.

##### Audio files

Enabling this option will cause audio files to be checked. Beyond that, no further crawling occurs with audio files.

##### Video files

Enabling this option will cause video files to be checked. Beyond that, no further crawling occurs with video files.

##### XML files

Enabling this option will cause XML files to be checked, and if applicable, crawled further.

This also includes Google Sitemap XML files. Disabling this option will cause those to not be downloaded and crawled.

##### Binary files

Binary files are any other file type for which no specific handling occurs.

For example, a linked .EXE file will have a HEAD request issued against it, to check that it is not a broken link.

{% include go-to-top.html %}

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

### Analysis Options

Set further localization, list processing, and analysis options here.

![SEO Macroscope analysis options](images/preferences-analysis-options.png){: .img-responsive .box-shadow .screenshot }

#### Web Server Options

##### Resolve server IP addresses

If checked, then the remote IP addresses for the host will be resolved and collected. Please note that each host may resolve to multiple IP addresses.

#### Localized Pages

##### Check linked HrefLang pages

Enabling this option will perform a simple HEAD request against detected HrefLang tags found in HTML pages.

By itself, this option will not cause SEO Macrosope to recurse into the websites referenced by the HrefLang tags if the referenced websites are considered to be "external."

Enable the *Follow HrefLang Links* option under the *Spidering Control* tab if you would like to also scan the websites referenced by the HrefLang tags.

##### Detect page text language

If this option is enabled, then SEO Macroscope will attempt to detect the written language of the web page.

The results of this may be checked elsewhere. In some cases, this may flag mis-specified page language configuration, or translation problems.

#### Process Document Types

Please note that HTML documents are *always* crawled.

Otherwise, to speed things up, we can exclude document types that we are not interested in crawling or processing further.

##### CSS stylesheets

Enabling this option will cause CSS stylesheets to be parsed, with some links inside further crawled and processed.

Please not that currently, there is partial support for crawling further linked assets, such as background images, within stylesheets.

##### Javascripts

Enabling this option will cause Javascripts to be downloaded and analyzed.

Beyond that, no further crawling occurs with Javascripts.

##### Images

Enabling this option will cause images to be downloaded and analyzed.

Beyond that, no further crawling occurs with images.

##### PDFs

Enabling this option will cause PDF files to be downloaded, and if possible, processed and analyzed.

If this option is enabled, PDF texts will be processed in the same manner as HTML text, including having their keyword terms analyzed, and Levenshtein processing applied.

This option is off by default. Please note that enabling this option may consume a more bandwidth.

##### Audio files

Enabling this option will cause audio files to be downloaded and analyzed.

Beyond that, no further crawling occurs with audio files.

##### Video files

Enabling this option will cause video files to be downloaded and analyzed.

Beyond that, no further crawling occurs with video files.

##### XML files

Enabling this option will cause XML files to be downloaded, analyzed, and if applicable, crawled further.

This also includes Google Sitemap XML files. Disabling this option will cause those to not be downloaded and crawled.

##### Binary files

Binary files are any other file type for which no specific handling occurs.

For example, a linked .EXE file will have a HEAD request issued against it, to check that it is not a broken link, but disabling this option will not download the file itself.

#### List File Processing

##### Scan sites in list

Enabling this option will cause SEO Macroscope to recurse into the websites for each URL in the URL list.

Please note that this may take a long time to complete if there are many websites included in the URL list.

Uncheck this option, if you only need to check the exact URLs in the URL list.

#### Search Index

##### Enable text indexing

If enabled, then text content in HTML pages will be indexed and searchable after a crawl.

##### Case sensitive indexing

If enabled, then text content will indexed and searchable in a case sensitive manner.

#### Page Fault Analysis

##### Warn about insecure links

Enabling this option will report insecure links to pages or resources from secure pages.

{% include go-to-top.html %}

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

### SEO Options

Configure SEO policies and analysis options here. SEO guidelines can change over time, so it is possible to set the ideal desired thresholds for certain page attributes as you see fit.

![SEO Macroscope SEO options](images/preferences-seo-options.png){: .img-responsive .box-shadow .screenshot }

#### Page Title Policies

##### Minimum title lenth

Set this to the minimum number acceptable characters, including white space, for page titles.

##### Maximum title lenth

Set this to the maximum number acceptable characters, including white space, for page titles.

##### Minimum title words

Set this to the minimum number acceptable number of words for page titles.

##### Maximum title words

Set this to the maximum number acceptable number of words for page titles.

##### Maximum title pixel width

Set this to the maximum acceptable width in pixels of the page title.

This value is calculated approximately.

#### Page Description Policies

##### Minimum description lenth

Set this to the minimum number acceptable characters, including white space, for page descriptions.

##### Maximum description lenth

Set this to the maximum number acceptable characters, including white space, for page descriptions.

##### Minimum description words

Set this to the minimum number acceptable number of words for page descriptions.

##### Maximum description words

Set this to the maximum number acceptable number of words for page descriptions.

#### Page Header Element Policies

##### Analyze heading elements cutoff

Set this option to the maximum page header level that you are interested in analyzing.

#### Document Text

##### Analyze keywords in page text

If this option is enabled, then some analysis is performed on keywords in the page body text.

Please note, this process occurs at the end of a scan, and may take quite some time to complete.

##### Analyze text readability

If this options is enabled, then the readability algorithm specified is appled to the document body text, dependent upon the document language.

##### English readability analysis method

Select the readability analysis algorithm for the English language.

#### Levenshtein Edit Distance Processing

In addition to other methods, I have implemented a [Levenshtein Edit Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) approach for attempting to detect near-duplicate content.

What this means is that for each HTML or PDF document that is fetched, the human-readable text is extracted and cleaned into a sanitized format.

By then applying the Levenshtein algorithm, we can discover pages that have text content that is similar to each other, within a certain threshold.

Please note that applying this method may incur a significant overhead, especially on larger crawls.

##### Enable Levenshtein Duplicate Detection

Enabling this option will make the Levenshtein Edit Distance algorithm be applied in some areas of the application.

Currently, the comparison data is only available in the duplicate content Excel report.

##### Levenshtein Analysis Level

The Levenshtein analysis can be quite expensive computationally, so there are two analysis levels that may be chosen to assist with speeding up the process.

When the text of each web page is extracted, SEO Macroscope generates a *"Levenshtein Fingerprint"* of the text. This is a vastly simplified representation of the text in the document, and may more quickly be analyzed.

* Level 1 will use only the Levenshtein Fingerprint for analysis of the document set. Generally, this will be sufficient to identify most near-duplicates in a reasonable time. This may yield false-positives.

* Level 2 will execute the Level 1 pass, but then apply the Levenshtein algorithm on the full text of documents that are identified as being near-duplicates.

##### Maximum Levenshtein Text Length Difference

This value is used to consider whether to apply the Levenshtein algorithm to two documents, or not.

The value is the difference in byte-lengths between the two texts of the two documents.

If the two documents are within this threshold, then the Levenshtein algorithm is applied, if not, then they are considered to be too different.

##### Levenshtein Edit Distance Threshold

Set this value to the maximum number of "edits" that consider the two documents to have very similar texts.

### Custom Filter Options

The custom filters may be used to check that your website pages contain, or do not contain, a specific value.

#### Enable/Disable Custom Filters

##### Enable custom filter processing

Enable this option to activate the custom filter processing during a crawl. Disabling this option may speed up a crawl slightly.

#### Custom Filter Items

##### Number of custom filters

Set this option to the exact number of custom filters needed for the crawl.

#### Apply Custom Filters to Document Types

Check only those document types that need to have custom filters applied to them. Unchecking unneeded document types may help to speed up the crawling process.

{% include go-to-top.html %}

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

### Data Extractor Options

Content may be scraped from the crawled pages by using regular expressions, XPath queries, or CSS selectors.

#### Enable/Disable Data Extractors

##### Enable data extraction processing

{: .screenshot }

#### Sitemaps

Specify additional options during sitemap generation.

##### Include linked PDFs

This takes effect when exporting XML and text sitemaps.

Enabling this option will cause links to PDFs from HTML pages to be included in the export sitemap, even if the PDF URL would normally be excluded from this crawl session.

{% include go-to-top.html %}

<!-- ======================================================================= -->

### Display Settings

These settings control how SEO Macroscope updates the display during a crawling operation.

![SEO Macroscope display settings](images/preferences-display-options.png){: .img-responsive .box-shadow .screenshot }

#### Overview Panels

##### Pause display during scan

Disabling this option will prevent the various list displays from being updated during crawling. This is mostly a cosmetic effect, but may reduce time it takes to complete the crawl slightly.

##### Show progress dialogues

Disabling this option will prevent progress dialogues from being displayed.

{% include go-to-top.html %}

#### CSS Selectors

Web scraping may be done with CSS selectors.

![CSS Selectors data extractors](images/task-data-extractor-css.png){: .img-responsive .box-shadow .screenshot }

Give each extractor a name, this will be used in the list views, and CSV/Excel reports, for each found item.

Enter a CSS selector query that will locate the data that you wish to extract.

Finally, specify whether the CSS selector should extract the matched HTML element and all of its children, only the matched child elements, or extract only the text value.

#### Regular Expressions

Web scraping may be done with regular expressions.

![Regular Expressions data extractors](images/task-data-extractor-regex.png){: .img-responsive .box-shadow .screenshot }

Give each extractor a name, this will be used in the list views, and CSV/Excel reports, for each found item.

Enter a regular expression that will locate the data that you wish to extract.

It is important that the regular expression includes capture groups; otherwise nothing will be extracted. Each capture group will be extracted into its own record.

#### XPath Queries

Web scraping may be done with XPath queries.

![XPath Queries data extractors](images/task-data-extractor-xpath.png){: .img-responsive .box-shadow .screenshot }

Give each extractor a name, this will be used in the list views, and CSV/Excel reports, for each found item.

<!-- *********************************************************************** -->

## Concepts

Explanations of how SEO Macroscope deals with a few details under the hood.

### "Internal" and "External" Hosts

Briefly, SEO Macroscope maintains the notion of a URL as belonging to either an "internal", or an "external" host.

Internal hosts will generally be crawled, dependent on other preference settings; whereas external hosts will not. In many places, URLs are highlighted as green when they are considered internal.

An "internal" host is one that is explicitly specified either via the **Start URL** field, or is present in a loaded or pasted URL list. There is also the option of using the context menu in some of the overview panels, to mark a particular URL as belonging to an internal host.

An "external" host is generally one that is linked to from HTML pages or stylesheets, but is different to the **Start URL** or URL list host(s).

Generally, external hosts will be issued a HEAD request, but will not be crawled.
